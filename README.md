# Quiz 
The project is to develop a web quiz. The quiz consits of 5 multiple choice questions with 4 answer options each. There will be a front page that initialized the quiz. There will be a page after the questions containing scores, requesting initials. The final page will give the best score and options to finalize or go back for another round. 

## Motivation
This project is homework04 from UT Coding Bootcamp.

### Prerequisites
The software will run in any webpage

## Tests 
* Timer: When quiz starts a timer should appear and give 75 seconds for the user to finish the quiz. If the answer is correct, it gets added to the score, if not, it decreases the score and time for the quiz.  

* Display one question per page.
* Provide score
* Requests initials 
* Buttons for quiz answers to be collected
* Button to leave or to go back to the quiz
